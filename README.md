Not Currently Online

A Shopify theme built for an online competition to use Shopify to sell soemthing you loved. I focused on "help" through the theme of selling robotic versions of myself to anyone who needed help. 

### Status

Finished. 

## Overview and Thoughts

Unfortunately the competition did not state the end date and I finished the day after the contest closed. Whoops. 

### What Worked

The site looks and acts as I hoped.
